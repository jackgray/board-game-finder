This is a simplified example of how you could use Relay with Next.js to fetch and display data about a board game based on an ID in the query parameters. Note that this example is incomplete and you would need to fill in the details according to your specific GraphQL API.

This example uses the getInitialProps method to fetch the data server-side before rendering the page. It then passes the preloaded query to the component using Relay's hooks API.

The query is written in GraphQL and fetches the id, name, description, and cost of the board game. You would need to extend this query to include all of the properties from your schema that you want to display.

The component itself is a simple functional component that displays the name, description, and cost of the board game. Again, you would need to extend this to display all of the properties you're interested in.

The actual Relay Environment setup and handling of the server-side data fetching (initEnvironment and fetchQuery) is not included in this example, and you would need to implement this according to the specifics of your GraphQL API.

Additionally, you would likely want to create more components to break down the complexity of the board game data and make it easier to work with.

For state management, Relay's local state management capabilities may be sufficient depending on your requirements.
